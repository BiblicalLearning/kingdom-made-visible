## 📖 About This Study

When God changes a heart, you are witnessing Jesus and His kingdom expand with power and authority. It becomes evident outwardly what God is doing inwardly.

The kingdom doesn't come with observable signs you can point to geographically (Luke 17:20-21), but its effects are **undeniable**. Every transformed life is proof that Christ reigns NOW.

This study reveals:
- **The Inward Work Produces Outward Evidence** - How internal transformation manifests externally
- **The Kingdom Coming in Power** - Where the power is and how it operates
- **The Same Power That Raised Christ** - Resurrection power at work in salvation
- **The Kingdom Expanding With Authority** - Every conversion is territory taken from darkness
- **Why Evangelism Matters** - You're not just saving souls, you're expanding the kingdom

## 💡 Key Concepts

### The Evidence of Transformation
When someone gets saved, people notice:
- Behavior transforms - "You're different"
- Countenance changes - peace, joy, hope become visible
- Priorities shift - what mattered becomes worthless
- Relationships heal - forgiveness, reconciliation, love
- Speech transforms - filth replaced with grace
- Life gains purpose - aimlessness to mission

### Kingdom Power Demonstrated
- Every salvation = dead made alive
- Every deliverance = captives set free
- Every transformation = darkness to light
- Every heart changed = stone to flesh

### The Progressive Conquest
- Every heart changed = another enemy conquered
- Every life transformed = more territory taken
- Every salvation = the kingdom advancing with power
